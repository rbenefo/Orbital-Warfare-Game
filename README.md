# Orbital-Warfare-Game
Basic orbital warfare game, inspired by John Lumpkin's Human Reach novels.


## About
The Pink ship and White ship are battling it out high above Earth. Each ship has a laser and coilgun. Ships flash red when they're hit, and in future versions, will have a limited amount of health, and limited fuel/weapons.

## Basic Strategy
Lasers and coilguns deal the same amount of damage; however, coilguns are slow while lasers arrive instantaneously. Since lasers can destroy incoming coilgun shells, a useful tactic (taken straight from John Lumpkin's books), is to think about coilguns as creating "terrain" that the enemy ship needs to navigate. To prevent the enemy ship from bringing its laser to bear on you, send some coilgun shells their way to force them either to turn and thrust to dodge, or turn and fire directly at the incoming shells.

Enjoy!
